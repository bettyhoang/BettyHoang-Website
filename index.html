       <p class="lead mb-4">Hi! I’m Betty Hoang, an aspiring UX + Visual designer.

I’ve always loved to be creative through art and design, and now I am currently the UX/UI Lead at UC Riverside’s first ever Designathon and the VP of Marketing for Design@UCR, UC Riverside’s only student organization supporting students interested in UI/UX, web design, and design thinking! 
<br><br>
In addition to my involvement in my own school extracurriculars, I also like to be active in designations and hackathons hosted by other organizations and school, winning Best UX/UI at Cutie Hack 2022 and 3rd Place Prize at Jumpstart Designathon 2023.

I am currently on the lookout for any intern positions in the San Bernardino, Ontario, or Riverside area, or any remote position. I love to draw and have experience prototyping in Figma in my free time. I have a passion for art and hope to use my critical thinking skills in tandem with my creative side to become a thriving designer!
